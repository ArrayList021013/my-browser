/**
 * this class is designed to manage async operations in a sequential manner
 * 
 * 1. Queue Class and Properties:
 *     The class manages a list of asynchronous tasks (promises) in an array called queue
 *     and tracks if a task is currently running using pendingPromise.
 * 2. Enqueue Method: This method adds a new asynchronous task to the queue
 *     and starts processing the queue if itâ€™s not already processing.
 * 3. Dequeue Method: This method runs the tasks one by one in the order they were added:
 * 
 * If a task is already running, it does nothing.
 * If no task is running, it takes the next task from the queue and runs it.
 * When the task finishes, it marks the task as done and runs the next task in the queue.
